# Schema

*GraphQL* schema is generated by passing all the operations (query/mutation/subscription) functions to `apischema.graphql.graphql_schema`. 

Functions parameters and return types are then processed by *Apischema* to generate the `Query`/`Mutation`/`Subscription` types with their resolvers/subscribers, which are then passed to `graphql.graphql_schema`.
