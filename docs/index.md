# Overview

## apischema

Makes your life easier when it comes to python API.

JSON (de)serialization, *GraphQL* and JSON schema generation through python typing, with a spoonful of sugar.

## Install
```shell
pip install apischema
```
It requires only Python 3.6+ (and dataclasses [official backport](https://pypi.org/project/dataclasses/) for version 3.6 only)

*PyPy3* is fully supported.

## Why another library?

This library fulfills the following goals:

- stay as close as possible to the standard library (dataclasses, typing, etc.) — as a consequence do not need plugins for editors/linters/etc.;
- be adaptable, provide tools to support any types (ORM, etc.);
- avoid dynamic things like using raw strings for attributes name - play nicely with your IDE.

No known alternative achieves all of this, and apischema is also [faster](performance_and_benchmark.md#benchmark) than all of them.

On top of that, because APIs are not only JSON, *apischema* is also a complete *GraphQL* library

!!! note
    Actually, *apischema* is even adaptable enough to enable support of competitor libraries in a few dozens of line of code ([pydantic support example](examples/pydantic_support.md) using [conversions feature](conversions.md))  

## Example

```python
{!quickstart.py!}
```
*apischema* works out of the box with you data model.

!!! note
    This example and further ones are using *pytest* API because they are in fact run as tests in the library CI

### Run the documentation examples

All documentation examples are written using the last Python minor — currently 3.9 — in order to provide an up-to-date documentation. Because Python 3.9 specificities (like [PEP 585](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/)) are used, this version is "mandatory" to execute the examples as-is.

Also, as stated above, examples are using `pytest.raises` as it is the most convenient way to test an exception is raised — and because it's simpler for the CI wrapping.

Moreover, *apischema* has a *graphql-core* dependency when it comes to example involving *GraphQL*.

At last, some examples of the [Examples](examples) section are using third-party libraries: *SQLAlchemy*, *attrs* and *pydantic*.

All of these dependencies can be downloaded using the `examples` dependencies with 
```shell
pip install apischema[examples]
```

Once dependencies are installed, you can simply copy-paste examples and execute them, using the proper Python version. 

## FAQ

#### What is the difference between *apischema* and *pydantic*?

See the [dedicated section](difference_with_pydantic.md), there is a lot of difference. 

#### I already have my data model with my *SQLAlchemy*/ORM tables, will I have to duplicate my code, making one dataclass by table?
Why would you have to duplicate them? *apischema* can "work with user own types as well as foreign libraries ones". Some teasing of [conversion](conversions.md) feature: you can add default serialization for all your tables, or register different serializer that you can select according to your API endpoint, or both.

#### I need more accurate validation than "ensure this is an integer and not a string ", can I do that?
See the [validation](validation.md) section. You can use standard JSON schema validation (`maxItems`, `pattern`, etc.) that will be embedded in your schema or add custom Python validators for each class/fields/`NewType` you want.
